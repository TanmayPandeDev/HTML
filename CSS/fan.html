        Fans work by converting electrical energy into mechanical energy, which then creates airflow to provide cooling
        and ventilation. The core principle is that an electric motor drives fan blades, causing them to rotate and move
        air. This movement of air generates a cooling effect by increasing evaporation of sweat and displacing warm air
        with cooler air.
        Here's a more detailed explanation:
        1. Electrical to Mechanical Energy Conversion:
        A fan uses an electric motor to power its blades.
        The motor's electrical current passes through coils and a rotor, converting the energy into mechanical motion.
        This motion rotates the fan blades, which are attached to the rotor.
        2. Airflow and Cooling:
        As the blades rotate, they push air, creating airflow.
        This airflow moves around the room, displacing warmer air with cooler air.
        The movement of air also helps to evaporate sweat, creating a cooling sensation.
        3. Bernoulli's Principle:
        Ceiling fans utilize Bernoulli's principle, which states that as air moves faster, its pressure decreases.
        As the blades rotate, they create a low-pressure zone above them, drawing air from below and pushing it
        downward.
        4. Types of Fans and Airflow Direction:
        Axial fans: move air in the same direction as the fan's shaft, like propeller fans.
        Centrifugal fans: push air in a radial direction, like in some industrial ventilation systems.
        Mixed-flow fans: combine both axial and radial airflow.
        5. Key Components:
        Motor: Drives the fan blades.
        Blades: Attached to the motor and rotate to create airflow.
        Impeller/Rotor: The rotating assembly of blades and hub.
        Housing/Case: Encloses the fan and may direct airflow.
